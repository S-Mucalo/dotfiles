I'm using Arch Linux and this repo represents a huge part of my system configuration.
Scroll down to see what it looks like.
Forking is highly encouraged.

## Installation

Run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/S-Mucalo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```
and then execute the script. This should symlink all the files in the `~/.dotfiles` directory to the correct
locations in your home folder. Backups will be moved to a backup folder.

### Wallpaper

Simply place wallpapers in the `~/.wallpaper/` directory and everything should work fine.
