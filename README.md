## dotfiles

I'm using Arch Linux and this repo represents a huge part of my system configuration.
For now there's not much here, but I will add more in the future.
Forking is highly encouraged.

## Installation

Run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmlye/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```
and then execute the script. This should symlink all the files in the `~/.dotfiles` directory to the correct
locations in your home folder.

## Credit

Credit for the colors and the zsh config goes to [crshd] (https://github.com/crshd), from whom I copied most of it.
The awesome config is not my own for a large part either, sadly I don't remember where I found it.
This repo is heavily inspired by [holman's dotfiles] (https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
